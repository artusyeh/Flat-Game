Devlog: Welcome to Blob Land.

At first I was planning to make a dark and serious game with a creepy art style. But halfway through the project I revisited the Fortnite Choral Lobby music, and for some reason 
blobfish popped into my mind, and so the game instantly took a 180. Instead of eerie and dark, I decided to lean into a playful, funny vibe that matches the lighthearted feel of 
that music. I really wanted the game to feel like it’s underwater so I edited the audio to sound muffled and ambient, like it’s being heard beneath the surface. I think it worked 
out pretty well. To keep things goofy and unexpected, I mixed in some of the most random sound effects I could think of. 

The result is a world that’s silly, surreal, and full of charm… just like a blobfish.
